## Project Overview

This project is a simple user management application built using React, Redux
Toolkit, and TypeScript. The main functionality is to display a table of users
fetched from a mock API and allow advanced filtering through search inputs in
each column. The application demonstrates state management using Redux and
TypeScript for type safety.

## Key Features

- **User Management Table**: Displays user information (name, username, email,
  phone) fetched from an API.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Allows users to filter data by any column (name,
  username, email, or phone) with real-time updates.
- **Redux for State Management**: Manages state for users and filter inputs
  using Redux Toolkit.
- **TypeScript for Type Safety**: Ensures type safety throughout the project to
  avoid runtime errors.
- **Adapted Desing with Mobile First Approach**.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building UI.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management.
- **Redux Persist**: For persisting and rehydrating the values of the filters.
- **TypeScript**: Enforces type safety across the application.
- **Axios/Fetch**: To make API calls.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: Mock API to fetch users data.
